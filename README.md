# VOS-dev
This OS is just an experiement of able to work on most old android phones, here is how it works - 
The OS works similar to how it works on a normal pc/laptop
Before the OS, it is recommended to install the vos checker app to check if your drivers for your phone/device are available in the database(at first the database will not have anything because project is still in development)
Will install fallback drivers(when drivers for your device are not found) to securely boot and install it manually, will have a guide page on that later.
More comming soon, so stay tuned!
